# Usecases

## download all new files
Application subscribes to all file creation events and downloads each file to local storage.

# Client interface options
Requirements:
* Active open-source community with stable code base.
* Portable code with support for all major PC platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows).
* Portable and embeddalbe code with support for microcontroller architectures (Pico & Arduino based).

Very few frameworks meet both of the last two requirements. Current focus is on proving the viability of any GUI devrelopment with `libindigo-rs` so selecting a framework for the firs iteration based only on the support for PC platforms.

Tried...

* `slint` promising for embedded development, initial issues related to the dynamic nature of INDIGO, to be revisisted.
* `gtk-rs` complex and too much cumbersome boiler plate, high learning curve.
* `relm` drastically simplifies GTK development on Rust, less boilerplte.

Settled on `relm` for the first tries of implementing a `libindigo-rs` GUI.
